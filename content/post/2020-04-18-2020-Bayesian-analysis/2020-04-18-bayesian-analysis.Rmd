Bayesian approach becomes more and more popular because of the improvement of mordern computing ability for machine learning and big data. Bayesian analysis is a completely different approach compared to frequentist approach. Yet, it's more challenging. To be able to understand and learn the Bayesian approch, `first`, we will need to have knowledge of conditional probability. `Second`, to have knowledge of different distributions such as normal, bernoulli, binomial, gamma, beta, cauchy,possion, etc. `Third`, to be familar with calculus. We need to calculate derivatives and integration of different distributions. `Last but not at least`, to be familar with simulation sampling technique such as Grid sampling, Variational Bayes and Monte Carlo Markov Chian (MCMC) including popular Gibbs sampling, Metropolis Hastings Sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo(HMC),etc. Luckily, there are a few software tools [Jags](https://web.sgh.waw.pl/~atoroj/ekonometria_bayesowska/jags_user_manual.pdf), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/) .etc can be used for Gibbs sampling and HMC.

The concept is simple. According to Bayes Theorem $p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(y)}$ or without normalization $p(\theta|y) \sim p(y|\theta)p(\theta)$, we want to gain the posterior distribution by using prior information and likelihood of the data information. Most of the time, we use log likelihood instead for easier calculation since $log( a*b )= loga +logb$. Bayesian approach involves much more math than frequentist approach and more complicated. Frequentist focus on one point (hypothesis), and bayesian focuses on a looking forward range.
