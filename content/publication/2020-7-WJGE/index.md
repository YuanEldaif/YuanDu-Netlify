abstract: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is an effective and minimally invasive alternative to surgery for large polyps and laterally spreading lesions. Gross morphology and surface characteristics may help predict submucosal invasion of the lesion (SMIL) during endoscopic evaluation. This is one of the largest single-center studies reporting endoscopic mucosal resection for larger (â‰¥ 20 mm) colorectal lesions in the United States.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: There was overall low prevalence of SMIL in our study. Kudo pit pattern (IIIL + IV and V) and Paris classification 0-IIc were the only factors identified as an independent risk factor for submucosal invasion. The independent risk factor for recurrence was adenoma size (> 40 mm). Almost all recurrences (98.8%) were treated endoscopically.
