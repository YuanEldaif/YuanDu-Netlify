abstract: In 2017, the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) stratified AML patients into 3 risk groups based on the presence or absence of specific chromosome abnormalities and selected gene mutations.1 However, some studies have suggested that the prognosis or CR rates are heterozygous in the 2017 ELN favorable group depending on the specific co-existing mutations.2 Although they were not included in 2017 ELN due to an insufficient accumulation of evidence, some mutations involved in DNA methylation, including DNMT3A and IDH1/2, revealed adverse effects in AML prognosis.1,3-5 The goal of the current study was to evaluate how the DNA methylation regulatory (DNA-MR) gene mutations may impact the outcomes of AML patients categorized as favorable risk according to the ELN risk stratification.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A total of 125 patients were qualified for the study and the median follow-up for the cohort was 404 days. Among ELN favorable risk patients (n = 45), the mutations of DNA-MR genes occurred in 19 (42.2%) patients: DNMT3A, 20% (9/45); IDH2, 13% (6/45); TET2, 11% (5/45); IDH1, 9% (4/25). This led to 19, 26, 38, and 42 patients classified as Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. In contrast, DNA-MR gene mutations were less common in ELN intermediate and adverse groups, and occurred in 34.2% (13/38) and 19.0% (8/42) respectively. Figure 1 shows OS and RFS of 4 groups by Kaplan-Myer Curve. The median OS for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 306, not reached, 987, and 422 days, respectively. There was significant difference in OS between ELN favorable with versus without DNA-MR gene mutations (Group 1 vs 2; p-value: 0.0002). There was no significant OS difference between ELN favor with DNA-MR gene mutations versus ELN intermediate (Group 1 vs 3; p-value: 0.0921) or versus ELN adverse group (Group 1 vs 4; p-value: 0.9455). The median RFS for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 511, not reached, 240, and 305 days. There was significant difference in RFS between ELN favorable with versus without DNA-MR gene mutations (Group 1 vs 2: adjusted p-value:0.0089). There were no significant RFS differences between ELN favorable with DNA-MR gene mutations versus intermediate (Group 1 vs 3; p value: 0.2304) or versus adverse group (Groups 1 vs 4; p-value: 0.6661). CR rate of groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 79%, 96%, 82% and 57% respectively. The CR rate of Group 1 was not statistically significantly different from CR rate of Group 2, 3, and 4. Further subgroup analysis revealed that the co-existing DNA-MR gene mutations did not impact OS and RFS in ELN intermediate and adverse groups.
