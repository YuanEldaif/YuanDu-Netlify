abstract: A low-cost, quantitative method to evaluate sleep in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is both feasible for routine clinical practice and reliable does not yet exist. We characterised nocturnal ICU sleep using a commercially available activity tracker and evaluated agreement between tracker-derived sleep data and patient-perceived sleep quality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A Fitbit Charge 2 when applied to non-intubated adults in an ICU consistently collects TST data but not #AW or sleep stage data at night. The TST moderately correlates with patient-perceived sleep quality; a correlation between either #AW or sleep stages and sleep quality was not found.
