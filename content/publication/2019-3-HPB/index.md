abstract: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (PF) is a common complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Additional interventions to decrease incidence of PF may add cost and procedural risk to patients with variable Results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of routine pancreatico-jejunostomy reconstruction over external pancreatic stent on PF rates and severity after PD.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: During PD, reconstruction over an external pancreatic stent led to very low PF incidence with no significant difference observed in severity between patients with PDAC and other high fistula risk pathologies. Routine external pancreatic stent placement after PD, regardless of PF risk, may reduce incidence of PF and need for additional interventions.
