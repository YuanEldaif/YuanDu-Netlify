# Abstract: 1. Machine learning may differentiate AML-MRC from non-MRC AML using mutation profile. 2. 3 factors (Age, TP53, FLT3) could aid AML-MRC diagnosis with a scoring system. 3. AML-MRC had higher TP53 and lower NPM1, FLT3, NRAS, PTPN11 mutations frequencies.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
