abstract: The prognostic value of different KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene) mutation subtypes and their association with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) remain unclear. We examined the association of KRAS mutation subtypes with clinical outcomes and PD-L1 expression status.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: KRAS mutation subtype is not associated with patient clinical outcomes or PD-L1 expression status. However, PD-L1 positivity appears to negatively affect OS in LADC patients with G12C mutation. Further study is needed to confirm our observation and to determine if programmed cell death 1/PD-L1 antagonist may affect the clinical outcome of patients with different KRAS mutation subtypes.
