abstract: Recently, genomic mutation profiling of leukemic cells has been actively studied and some results have been integrated into the 2017 ELN classification with cytogenetic analysis for risk assessment of AML populations.1 However, only a few mutations are well identified and included in the 2017 ELN classification. In addition, except interaction between NPM1 and FLT-ITD, correlation and co-occurrence among various mutations have not been well studied. Here we describe our single center genomic landscapes of 2017 ELN guideline components with other NGS mutations in adult AML.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our cohort was male predominant (57%, 110/193) with median age of 64 YO (range 18 - 93). 29%, 25% and 46% of patients were 2017 ELN favorable, intermediate, and adverse group respectively. 27.5% and 40% were Adverse and Normal Karyotype respectively. 4%, 4% and 1% of patients were RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11 and MLLT3-KMT2A positive respectively. Figure1 describes the occurrence rate of significantly occurred mutations. Regarding 2017 ELN components, 37 patients (19.2%) were positive to NPM1, 34 patients (17.6%) had FLT-ITD low, 3 (1.6%) had CEBPA biallelic, 40 (20.7%) had TP53, 27 (14.0%) had ASXL, and 24 (12.4%) had RUNX. There was no FLT-ITD high mutation in our cohort. In total 63 patients (32.6%) had at least one DNA methylation mutation. 44 patients (22.8%) had at least one spliceosome mutation and 9 patients (4.6%) had at least one chromatin modifier mutation other than ASXL1. In activated signaling, NRAS, KRAS, FLT-TKD were significantly occurred.
