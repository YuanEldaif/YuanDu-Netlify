Summary: This modeling stacking approach is quite unique based on the data distribution. Choosing the appropreciate machine learning method based on the data distribution is the key of the success. 

It would be interesting to see similar problems in a global multi-locations problem, where each location has multivariate normal distribution but globally the data is non-normal with high kutotusis.
